  # Manage the network and related resources (subnets and segments) with either create, update, or delete operations (depending on the stack operation). Does not apply to ports which will always be managed as needed. Defaults to true. For multi-stack use cases where the network related resources have already been managed by a separate stack, this parameter can be set to false.
  # Type: boolean
  ManageNetworks: False

  # The availability zone where new Nova compute nodes will be added. If the zone does not already exist, it will be created. If left unset, it will default to the value of the stack name.

  # Whether instances can attach cinder volumes from a different availability zone.
